Running the Spring application is essential for the UI to be able to populate data.

Before you run the application, RUN CASSANDRA. This will ensure no errors are thrown while the app tries to connect
to Cassandra.

Now, open the root folder in your IDE as a Maven project and resolve dependencies.
This will turn the project into a Spring project that runs with Maven.

You can now run the CassandraTestApplication file. This starts the back-end portion of the entire application.
In order to see results, run the front-end.
